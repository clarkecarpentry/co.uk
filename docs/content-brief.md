# Content Brief

This document provides guidelines for generating content for the Clarke Carpentry website. Use this as the single source of truth for tone, messaging, and structure.

---

## 1. Brand Voice

### Tone

- **Professional** - We're a serious business that main contractors trust with major projects
- **Technical** - We know our trade and aren't afraid to use proper terminology
- **Expert-focused** - 15 years of experience backs up everything we say
- **Plain English** - Technical knowledge explained clearly, no unnecessary jargon

### Writing Style

**Do:**
- Use active voice ("We deliver" not "Projects are delivered")
- Be direct and concise - construction professionals are busy
- Include specific details where possible (project types, techniques, accreditations)
- Write with confidence - we know what we're doing
- Use "we" for company voice, creating a sense of team

**Don't:**
- Use marketing fluff or empty superlatives ("best in class", "world-leading")
- Be overly casual or use slang
- Make unsubstantiated claims
- Use exclamation marks (one per page maximum, if at all)
- Pad content with unnecessary words

### Example Transformations

| Instead of... | Write... |
|---------------|----------|
| "We are absolutely the best carpenters in the area!" | "With 15 years delivering projects across Bristol and Bath, we've built a reputation for quality workmanship." |
| "Our amazing team will help you" | "Our qualified carpenters handle projects from first fix through to completion." |
