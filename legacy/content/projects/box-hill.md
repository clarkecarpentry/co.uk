# Box Hill

**URL:** /box-hill-1
**Type:** Outdoor/Decking

## Description

This project was tailor made to the client's own specification. Former industrial courtyard was transformed into a relaxing and usable space, consisting of decking throughout. Pergolas were used to frame the panoramic views whilst custom build planters softened the outline. We also renovated the Bath stone walls and installed spotlighting to bring the space alive at night.

**Work completed:** March 2019
